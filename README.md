# Post-Quantum Cryptography

This repository contains the solutions to exercises and implementations of post-quantum cryptosystems taught in the Post-Quantum Cryptography course of the **Master in International Cybersecurity and Cyberintelligence** program during the **University of Granada** semester.

## Lattice-Based Cryptography

Lattice-based cryptography leverages the mathematical structure of lattices to construct problems that remain difficult to solve, even for quantum computers.  
The algorithms implemented in this section include:

- **GGH/HNF cryptosystem**
- **LLL attack**
- **NTRU cryptosystem**
- **LWE cryptosystem**

In addition to these algorithms, several exercises assigned during the course were completed. You can find the exercises and their solutions here:
